# Doubly-Linked Generic Queue

This is a portion of our larger grocery store simulation project, which will
close out the Fall semester.

## Implementing `QueueInterface`
Create a class that implements `structures.QueueInterface`. The queue you are
implementing should be unbounded and meet the big-O time complexities specified
in the interface.

**Tip:** Donâ€™t try to implement your entire `Queue` class all at once. Start by
looking at the tests provided in structures. Start the test that looks the least
complex, and implement the parts that will allow that test to pass. Once those
tests pass, look for another test to implement.

**Note**: For obvious reasons, you may not use any of the provided `Collection`
classes in the java standard API. A list of them can be seen in the
[Outline of the Collections Framework](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/doc-files/coll-reference.html)
